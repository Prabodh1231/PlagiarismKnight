            How accurate is PlagCheck compared to university tools?
            <span class="toggle">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              While PlagCheck provides a solid foundation for plagiarism
              detection, it's important to note that it doesn't have access to
              the extensive proprietary databases that university-provided tools
              often use. PlagCheck works by comparing your document against the
              reference materials you provide, making it extremely effective for
              checking against course materials but less comprehensive for
              detecting similarities with published works not included in your
              references.

              Absolutely. PlagCheck operates entirely within your browser. There
              is no backend server processing your documents, no data storage,
              and no transmission of your content over the internet. Your
              documents never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy and
              security. The advertisements are loaded separately and have no
              access to your uploaded files or their content.

              While primarily designed for students, PlagCheck can be used by
              anyone looking to verify the originality of their written content.
              However, for professional publications or critical documents, we
              recommend using it as a preliminary check before employing more
              comprehensive commercial solutions.
