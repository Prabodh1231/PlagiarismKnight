          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            This project is the passion-driven work of a solo developer and
            researcher who understands firsthand the struggles of working within
            institutions that lack access to expensive integrity-checking tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frustrated by the gap between well-funded institutions and
            under-resourced ones, our developer set out to build a solution that
            levels the playing field — a plagiarism checker that is free,
            private, and effective. While we acknowledge that our solution may
            not replace comprehensive institutional systems, it provides an
            essential <span class="highlight">preliminary checker</span> for
            those who need it most.
          </p>
          <p>
            Small steps like these move us closer to a future where academic
            integrity is accessible to everyone, regardless of their
            institutional background.

          <ul class="audience-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Independent researchers</strong> who need to ensure their
              work is original before submission
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Academicians from under-resourced institutions</strong>
              without access to expensive plagiarism detection tools
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Students preparing papers or theses</strong> who want to
              check their work before submission
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Educators seeking</strong> a trustworthy, secure way to

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the academic world, publication is critical — and while
            paraphrasing and referencing are natural parts of writing, checking
            for originality should be easily accessible to all. Our tool detects
            even subtle similarities, helping scholars maintain high ethical
            standards.
